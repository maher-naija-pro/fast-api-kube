"""
Test suite for validating IP addresses via the /v1/tools/validate endpoint
in the FastAPI application.

This module contains test cases for the following scenarios:
1. Validating a valid IPv4 address and ensuring the response confirms
   that the IP is valid.
2. Validating an invalid IP address and ensuring the appropriate error
   message and status code are returned.
3. Validating a valid IPv6 address, with the expectation that it
   might return a "valid" flag based on the applicationâ€™s business logic.

The client fixture is used to interact with the FastAPI application,
allowing the test cases to simulate HTTP requests and validate
responses.

    Test case for validating a valid IPv4 address.

    This test ensures that:
    1. A POST request is made to the /v1/tools/validate endpoint

    2. The request returns a 200 status code, indicating successful
    validation.
    3. The response JSON contains the correct IP address and a "valid"
    flag set to True.

    Expected behavior:
    - Status code should be 200 (OK).
    - The response should confirm the IP is valid with the correct
    IP address
    and "valid" flag set to True.
